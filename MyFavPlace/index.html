    <h1>Yosemite National Park, California</h1>


    <p>Yosemite is a is fantastic magical national park. This is a shot of Glaciar point, one of the most popular points in the park. When I was there we hiked back to the bottom of the park via the Panorama Trail, which begins at this point. The Panorama Trail was 11 miles long and I was sore for days.</p>

    <h1>Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii</h1>

    <p> This is a random beach in Hawaii. I've never been there, but it looks very pretty and I want to go. My shadow Barb really likes Hawaii and also would really love to visit sometime. This image is a reminder of what we're missing out on. :) </p>
